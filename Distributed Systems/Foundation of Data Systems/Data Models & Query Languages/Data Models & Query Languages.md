Data models are profound in that they make us implement our ideas of how to think and reason about problems effectively. Most applications layer multiple data models on top of each other as you go down the stack and begin to think differently about the sub-problem you're solving with each layer hiding some complexity of the layer below it.

There are many different kinds of data model, each having assumptions and goals about how it should be used and what problems it is efficient at solving. Therefore choosing an appropriate data model is important. 

This section discusses the differing data models and querying languages one may consider.
