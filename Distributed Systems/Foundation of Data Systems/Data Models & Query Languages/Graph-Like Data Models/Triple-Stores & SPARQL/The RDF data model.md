The turtle language we used previously is human readable format for RDF ( Resource description framework ) data. There are other options to write RDF data in such as XML, but turtle is less verbose and there are tools that exist to convert one RDF format into another. 

The main idea is you can use the RDF ( which in turn specifies ways of using the triple-store model in specific data formats ) to create connections between websites. I.E. the subject, predicate, object format of triple stores can be used to connect data together using URIs. So we could have a subject URI for a facebook account and an object URI for a linkedin account and connect the two with a predicate URI that simply notes that the two are linked.

It's important to note that these are URI's ***not*** URLs, I.E. they don't need to resolve anything, in the example above our predicate could look like `example.com/predicates/hasLinkedInProfile` and even if this didn't resolve to anything we can still understand the connection (edge). This way if the connection on the other end has a different way of labeling edges, there's no conflicts.
