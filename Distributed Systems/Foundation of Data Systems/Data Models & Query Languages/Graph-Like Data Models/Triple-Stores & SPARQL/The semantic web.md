One are where the triple store model is used is in the creation of the semantic web, using the RDF model.

The semantic web is the idea that since websites already publish text and pictures for humans, we could publish the same information in a machine-readable format for computers. [[The RDF data model]] (Resource description framework) was developed as a mechanism to enable this allowing for websites to be combined and have a *web of data*. Meaning in addition to human readable text, websites would publish their data as machine-readable formats, and when a change was made the data could automatically be updated across the web.

While the semantic web ( at least in 2024 ) has yet to explode in popularity, the triple-store model that the semantic web utilizes ( using the RDF model ) is still useful for specific applications.
