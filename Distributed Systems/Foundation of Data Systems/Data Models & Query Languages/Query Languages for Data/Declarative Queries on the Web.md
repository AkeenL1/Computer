Declarative Query languages have uses outside of of databases, one such use case is the web. Languages like CSS are declarative, meaning if you want to set an element to blue, all you need to do is declare it as such in CSS (XSL also provides this same functionality). The imperative option would be to use something like javascript's DOM API to get the elements and set their background to blue based on some condition. Doing so is *possible* but has some down sides
1. If the condition changes (I.E. the specific class you want to color is removed) the blue color won't be removed even of the code is rerun, to update the document you'd need to refresh the page, with css the browser automatically detects updates and applies them accordingly
2. If you want to take advantage of a new API, you have to rewrite the code. However browsers can make CSS improvements and the end user doesn't need to make any changes to their code as it is still compatible. 
These down sides to imperative programming (and upsides to declarative programming) are similar in database languages like SQL.
