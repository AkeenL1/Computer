Compared to the hierarchical and network models modern document databases have some core differences. The similarities lie in how data is stored, using a format good for storing one-to-many relationships and most commonly as denormalized data I.E. storing the data in nested records in the parent instead of separate records

However in cases when many-to-one or many-to-many relationships are needed document databases don't require access paths like CODASYL rather they use the foreign keys in the same way relational databases do, except they're called document references. This identifier is resolved at read time by a join or follow up queries. Meaning that modern day documents are not *exactly* like historical hierarchical models and share some similarity the relational model school of thought.
