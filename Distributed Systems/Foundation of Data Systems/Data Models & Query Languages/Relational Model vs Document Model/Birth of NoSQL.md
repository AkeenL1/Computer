NoSQL databases ( Not Only SQL ) are similar to the previous non-relational databases in the early 1970s & 80s. There are several reasons for the want for a non-relational databases including

* Greater scalability
* Preference for FOSS
* Specialized queries
* Frustration w/ the restrictiveness of sql

Now and as databases progress its become more common to see relational db's used alongside the NoSQL models resulting in something known as *polygot* persistence.
