The best known data model today is likely SQL, which was defined theoretically in the 1970s, organizing data into *relations* ( tables in SQL ) where each relation is an unordered set of tuples ( rows in SQL ). This method of data modeling translated well into transaction processing and batch processing both of which were widely used by large businesses at the time. Other databases made developers think about the way their data was stored while SQL managed to abstract that away behind a clean interface.

Other models such as the network model, hierarchical model, and object models came throughout the 1970s - 90s but never stuck as much as SQL did. This is because SQL generalized very well into a whole host of different application outside of the business transactions it was initially used for.
