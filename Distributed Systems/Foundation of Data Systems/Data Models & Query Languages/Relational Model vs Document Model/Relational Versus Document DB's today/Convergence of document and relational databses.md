Nowadays document and relational databases more than ever have many similarities making the "line in the sand" so to speak a little blurred.

Relational databases have added support for XML and JSON documents as well as ways to index and query inside the documents. As the commonality of JSON web API's rises relational databases are able to avoid impedance mismatch that plagued them previously by adding this support for other document formats.

Document databases also have taken some ideas from relational databases, with some databases supporting relational-like joins in custom query languages. Also resolving references to other documents automatically, allowing for normalized data on documents and still keeping the data logic outside of the application layer.

These increasing similarities is a good thing as it provides more options for users looking for data models that reflect their specific use case.
