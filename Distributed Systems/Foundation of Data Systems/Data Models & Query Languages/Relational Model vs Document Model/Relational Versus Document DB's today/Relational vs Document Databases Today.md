There are many differences between relational and document databases, this section mainly covers the difference in their data model.

That being the arguments in favor of the document database includes
* Schema Flexibility
* Better performance due to locality
* Closer to data structures used by application ( closer to oop conceptually)

The arguments in favor of relational databases include
* better support for joins ( I.E. better support for logic in the database layer )
* Better representation of many-to-many and many-to-one relationships

Discussed:
[[Which data model leads to simpler code]]
[[Schema flexibility in the document model]]
[[Data locality for queries]]
[[Convergence of document and relational databses]]
