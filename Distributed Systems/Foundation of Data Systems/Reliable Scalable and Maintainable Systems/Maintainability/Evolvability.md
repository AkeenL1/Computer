Evolvability is simply the ability for the system to adapt to changing requirements over time. It's in fact *extremely likely* that a systems requirements are in constant flux so having an evolvable system becomes important.

Organizational processes such as Agile provide a framework to work in such a way that allows quicker adaption to change, it also provides technical tools such as TDD and refactoring techniques to help with this evolvability.

Achieving evolvability in a large system can become a difficult thing but a systems evolvability is closely linked to its simplicity and abstraction, so working to achieve simplicity will likely result in a system being evolvable as well.
