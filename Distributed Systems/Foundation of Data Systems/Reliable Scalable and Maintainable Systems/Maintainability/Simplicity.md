As projects get larger they often become more *complex* due to a host of reasons. As stated in operability, operations is the most expensive area for a software project and high complexity makes things more expensive to maintain. It also makes things *harder* to maintain and change w/o unintended consequences and possibly accidental complexities.

Focusing on having simplicity in our systems can remove the accidental complexities while keeping the functionality and capability of the system. One of the best tools for removing complexity and keeping functionality is *abstraction* which is effectively what everything software engineers deal with is. Programming and Querying languages for example are simple abstractions over machine calls & algorithms on disk. Finding good abstraction is very difficult but finding well-defined reusable components is an important part to the simplicity of the system.
