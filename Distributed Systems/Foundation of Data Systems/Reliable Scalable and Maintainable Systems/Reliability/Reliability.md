* Generally speaking *reliability* is the ability for a system to continue to work correctly even when things go wrong
	* These "things that can go wrong" are called *faults*
	* A system that can anticipate faults and cope w/ them are called *fault-tolerant* are resilient
	* However not all faults are equal ( and not everything that goes wrong is a fault ) therefore it makes sense to talk about certain types of faults

### Faults and Failures
* A fault is not the same as a failure
	* A fault is one component of a system deviating from its spec
	* A failure is when the system as a whole stops providing the required service to the user
* It's usually best to design fault-tolerance mechanisms that prevent faults from causing failures
* In *fault-tolerant* systems we may want to trigger faults deliberately as a way to ensure the fault-tolerance is continuously tested
