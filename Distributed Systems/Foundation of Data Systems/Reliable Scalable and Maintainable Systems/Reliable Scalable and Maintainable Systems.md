* Many applications today are data-intensive rather than reliant on processing speed
* Data intensive applications need to do specific things such as 
	* Store data so that it can be found later - Database
	* Remember the results of an operation - Cache
	* Allow users to search or filter data - Search Index
	* Send messages to other processes - stream processing
	* Crunch large amounts of data - batch processing
* While these tools are standard the many different types of these tools solve different problems in different ways
* This means there should be specific ways in [[Thinking about Data Systems]] that allow use to create good systems
