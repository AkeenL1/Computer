In the previous section we discussed data models and query languages, so effectively how we give databases data and how we get it back. In this section we discuss how the databases store this data and how do we find it again after we've stored it. 

This topic is important for application developers as understanding the different storage engines and what to select is important, as well as understanding how to optimize them according to your needs. There is specifically a large difference databases for analytics vs databases for transactions. We'll examine two families of storage engines
1. Log Structured Storage Engines
2. Page Oriented Storage Engines ( Such as B-Trees )

[[Data structures that power your database]]
[[Transactions Processing or Analytics?]]
[[Column Oriented Storage]]
