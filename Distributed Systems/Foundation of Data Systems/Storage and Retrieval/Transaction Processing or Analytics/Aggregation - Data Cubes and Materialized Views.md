In data warehouses, since we already do quite a bit of computation (i.e. looking for the sum, average, min etc. ) we should cache those values so the lookup is faster. One way of creating this cache is by creating a materialized view. A standard view is effectively just the results of a query, but when you read from a view its actually just an execution of the query on the fly, where as a materialized view is the actual results written to disk. 

When the underlying data changes the materialized view needs to be updated because it contains only denormalized data this makes writes more expensive which is why many transaction based companies dont use this. But its better than a standard view for read heavy applications.

A special case of a materialized view is a data cube. A data cube is effectively a grid that aggregates two columns. I.E. if we had the product on the x axis and the date on the way axis each cell could represent the amount sold on that date. Then you can ask for specific rows or columns to get more summaries etc. The data itself can be expanded to tons of different columns not just two, creating a sort of multi-dimensional hypercube. The advantage of this is that certain queries become very fast. However there's low flexibility as it only works with queries looking for the dimensions that are included. For this reason raw data is preferred and only use data cubes on certain queries.
